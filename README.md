Zarhexcash Coin (ZAH) is a digital currency which is planned to be used as a sole means of payment in various decentralized applications (DApps) based on the Zarhexcash blockchain.  When establishing the system, the project team [made sure](https://zarhexcashpay.network/pages/governance-mechanism-of-zarhexcash) to adhere to the ideals of decentralization. In practice, this means no more financial scandals based on the conflict of interests. The Zarhexcash Coin network is operated by masternode owners. All masternode owners have made an initial investment of 1000 ZAH and thus they are interested in the increase of the system well-being. Various votes will be held to ensure the safe future of the project.

Zarhexcash Coin also has [its own implementation](https://zarhexcashpay.network/whitepaper/contracts) of the popular Smart Contracts technology based on Javascript. Zarhexcash smart contracts have been designed with bets in mind, meaning they will adequately respond to the needs of two planned DApps: [Zarhexcash.Exchange](https://zarhexcashpay.network/whitepaper/exchange), a transparent binary options marketplace, and Zarhexcash.Bet, a sports betting platform. To test the said smart contracts and their new variants, the Zarhexcash team is making a sandbox environment and development kit called Zarhexcashjs, see its [GitHub page](https://github.com/ZarhexcashPay/zarhexcashjs) to learn more about its code.

Zarhexcash Coin will soon move to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, meaning that masternode owners and the number of stakes held by each participant will be compared and automatically regulated. This ‘see-saw’ principle comes from Zerocoin whitepaper and the cryptocurrency called PIVX. The move to PoS is backed by several crucial factors: there will be a reduction of block time and the subsequent increase of the speed of transactions, scalability (long-term growth) issues will be solved and, lastly, mining whales will not be able to harm the project economy anymore. Details [can be read](https://zarhexcashpay.network/pages/proof-of-stake-explained) in a dedicated educational material. An illustrative table which compares the main features of Zarhexcash blockchain to other popular products [is available](https://zarhexcashpay.network/pages/zarhexcash-blockchain-the-best-features-of-dash-and-ethereum) in a separate article.
